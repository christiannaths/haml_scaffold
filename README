This plugin has recently gone under major reconstruction. Please refer to this readme for updated options.

HamlScaffold
============
  This plugin creates scaffolds with .html.haml views rather than the
  traditional .haml.erb views, and creates Sass stylesheets instead of
  the traditional .css stylesheets.
  
  Additional ui frameworks have been added: jQuery & jQuery-ui for javascript and BlueprintCSS for css.
  
  Also, form error messages are now displayed inline using the label tag.

Requires
=======
  Rails 2.2.0+
  Haml

Install
=======
  install this as a plugin to your rails app with
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/cnaths/haml_scaffold.git
  
  be sure to include the haml plugin in your rails app with:
  ./haml --rails [path/to/app]
  *see haml for more info

Example
=======
  ./script/generate haml_scaffold Post title:string body:text
  
Options
=======
  --layout //Generate layout components
  --erb //Generate erb views/layouts and css stylesheets rather than haml/sass
  --skip-timestamps //Don't add timestamps to the migration file for this model
  --skip-migration //Don't generate a migration file for this model

Notes
=======
  "ActionView::Base.default_form_builder = InlineFormErrors" will be added to your environment.rb file during installation. This is to give error messages inside input labels. Delete this line to restore default form builder functionality.
  
  include tags will be written to the layouts/_includes partial during scaffolding
