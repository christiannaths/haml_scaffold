HamlScaffold
============
  This plugin creates scaffolds with .html.haml views rather than the
  traditional .haml.erb views, and creates Sass stylesheets instead of
  the traditional .css stylesheets.
  
  Otherwise, all other aspects of the
  core rails scaffolding is intact.

Requires
=======
  Rails 2.1.0+
  Haml

Install
=======
  install this as a plugin to your rails app with
  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/cnaths/haml_scaffold.git
  
  be sure to include the haml plugin in your rails app with:
  ./haml --rails [path/to/app]
  *see haml for more info

Example
=======
  ./script/generate haml_scaffold Post title:string body:text

Notes
=======
  Stylesheets are generated with Sass, so stylesheets/sass/mystyle.sass 
  becomes stylesheets/mystyle.css
  
  It is useful to include the sass stylesheet in a 'master' sheet. For
  this purpose there is a stylesheets/sass/styles.sass file included.
  
  Include your stylesheets with:
    @import mystyle.sass
    
  Then
    = stylesheet_link_tag "styles"
  in your main layout
  
  *see Sass for more info
